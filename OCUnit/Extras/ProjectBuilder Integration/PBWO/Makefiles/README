OCUnit Makefiles README (For OPENSTEP, WEBOBJECTS, YELLOW BOX/NT, PB WO)

The content of this folder should be merged with your local Makefiles directory, for instance /Local/Developer/Makefiles (note that /Network/Developer/Makefiles is not searched by ProjectBuilder).

Doing the operations below allows you to run tests from ProjectBuilder and get nice error reporting in ProjectBuilder build panel. The test, test_debug, test_all and test_debug_all targets will be defined and included in your makefiles (you don't have to edit your Makefile.preamble or Makefile.postamble). 
Unless you have installed SenTestableProjects, a bundle for ProjectBuilder, you still need to add these targets to your project (for instance in ProjectBuilder's Build Attributes inspector).

You can ignore the CVS folders.

* Resources/otestSpec.plist
Defines the syntax of test results to be processed by the BuildFilter tool. It is used to report errors in ProjectBuilder's build panel top view. 

If you changed the installation directory for otest, reflect that change in this file: edit the "Executables" plist to the path of otest on your system (otest is a tool project of OCUnit).


* pb_makefiles/test.make
Defines the test and test_debug targets. 

If you changed the installation directory for otest, reflect that change in this file. Add to your local pb_makefiles.


* pb_makefiles/common.make.postamble
Includes test.make . 
Should be merged with your pb_makefiles/common.make.postamble.


* pb_makefiles/aggregate.make.preamble
Defines recursive test and test_debug targets. 
Should be merged with your pb_makefiles/aggregate.make.preamble.
