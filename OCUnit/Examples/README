These are mostly trivial examples to demonstrate how OCUnit can be used in different situations.

Xcode Note:
Currently, only Person, PersonComplete, SenRandomTest and Testable/Application (as an example of testing the UI) have been ported to Xcode. The remaining projects can be converted at will.


* SenRandomTest
Tests the SenRandom class and compares its result and performance (approximatively) to several pseudo random number generators.

* SenFoundationPerformanceTest
Compares (approximatively!) the speed of 3 different ways of iterating through an array.



The following projects contain mostly tests that intentionally fail.

* Testable/Application
Tests a simple application. Includes a test in a nib.

* Testable/ApplicationBundle
Shows how you can separate your tests from an application if you want to deploy without SenTestingKit. Just deploy your application without the bundle. A current limitation of this approach is that you have to use -SenTest All to run the tests from the bundle.

* Testable/Bundle.bproj
Tests in a bundle

* Testable/Framework.fproj
Tests in a framework

* Testable/FrameworkWithJava
A pair of frameworks that exhibited a bug, submitted by Peter Lindberg, from Oops, Sweden (thanks!). OCUnit v16 and above should successfully test this.

* Testable/tool
Tests in a tool

* Testable/WebFramework
Tests in a framework linked with WebObjects. OCUnit v16 and above should successfully test this.
