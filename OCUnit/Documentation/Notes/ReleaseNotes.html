<p>New in Release v41 (April 2, 2005), thanks to Chris Hanson<br />
<UL>

<p>New in Release v40 (March 29, 2005)<br />
<ul>
	<li> Two new assertion macros have been added and an old one deprecated. The two new ones are STAssertEqualScalars() and STAssertEqualScalarsWithAccuracy(). STAssertEquals() has been deprecated. These new macros give better formatting of the scalar amounts in case of failure. Also the macro STAssertEqualScalarsWithAccuracy() allows the use of an accuracy amount in case of floats and doubles where the values may not be exact.
